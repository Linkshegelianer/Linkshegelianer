ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Linkshegelianer. I'm a beginner currently enrolling for a CS/informatics bachelor in Europe. I've decided to start practicing by myself in advance so that I can become a good dev sooner.    

As a first PL I've chosen C, but now my mostly-used language is Java. 

I'll use this GitHub for personal projects to track my progress and save the best examples of the code I've written.
